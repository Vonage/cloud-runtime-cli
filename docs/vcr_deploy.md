## vcr deploy

Deploy a VCR application

### Synopsis

Deploy a VCR application.

This command will package up the local client app code and deploy it to the VCR platform.

A deployment manifest should be provided so that the CLI knows how to deploy your application. An example manifest would look like:

project:
	name: booking-app
instance:
	name: dev
	runtime: nodejs18
	region: aws.euw1
	application-id: 0dcbb945-cf09-4756-808a-e1873228f802
	environment:
		- name: VONAGE_NUMBER
		  value: "12012010601"
    capabilities:
		- messages-v1
		- rtc
	entrypoint:
		- node
		- index.js
	security:
		access: private
		override:
			- path: "/api/public"
			  access: public
			- path: "/v1/users/*/profile"
			  access: public
debug:
	name: debug
	application-id: 0dcbb945-cf09-4756-808a-e1873228f802
	environment:
		- name: VONAGE_NUMBER
		  value: "12012010601"
	entrypoint:
		- node
		- index.js

By default, the CLI will look for a deployment manifest in the root of the code directory under the name 'vcr.yml'.
Flags can be used to override the mandatory fields, ie project name, instance name, runtime, region and application ID.

The project will be created if it does not already exist.

#### Security Configuration

The `security` configuration allows you to control access to your application and specific paths:

- **public**: Allows public access to reach those paths
- **private**: Returns forbidden for those paths

**Default Behavior:**
If no `security` field is specified in your manifest, all endpoints will default to public access.

**Configuration Structure:**
- `access`: Sets the default access level for all paths (either "public" or "private")
- `override`: Array of path-specific access overrides

**Wildcard Support:**
- Use `*` to match a single path segment: `/v1/users/*/settings`
- Use `**` to match multiple path segments: `/v1/**`

**Examples:**
```yaml
# Example 1: Default public with specific private paths
security:
  access: public
  override:
    - path: "/api/admin"
      access: private
    - path: "/v1/internal/**"
      access: private

# Example 2: Default private with specific public paths
security:
  access: private
  override:
    - path: "/api/health"
      access: public
    - path: "/v1/users/*/profile"
      access: public
```


```
vcr deploy [path_to_code] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
# Deploy code in current app directory.
$ vcr deploy .
		
# If no arguments are provided, the code directory is assumed to be the current directory.
$ vcr deploy

```

### Options

```
  -i, --app-id string          Set the id of the Vonage application you wish to link the VCR application to
  -c, --capabilities string    Provide the comma separated capabilities required for your application. eg: "messaging,voice"
  -f, --filename string        File contains the VCR manifest to apply
  -n, --instance-name string   Instance name
  -p, --project-name string    Project name
  -r, --runtime string         Set the runtime of the application
  -z, --tgz string             Provide the path to the tar.gz code you wish to deploy. Code need to be compressed from root directory and include library
```
